These bswx files contain my Stackexchange Codegolf contributions.
The files themselves should not be run because they contain weblinks that would cause additional bees and other potential problems. Just copy and paste the source code to a fresh file to make the code runnable.

Warning: The program '!' has to be stored under the same name to make it work.
The program can only be run once because the code modifies the content and saves the modified content under the same program name.

Enjoy!
